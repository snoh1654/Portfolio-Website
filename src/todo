!!! Bug fix with horizontal scrollbar 1, I think its fixed? Disappeared on its
own. try using shift+scroll and refreshing with cache deletion when testing
again in the future. ipad air is bugged, it offers half the space while
requiring full content, dont worry about that viewport !!! Make navbar be fixed
1, fixed but idk why the container fixes it Change margins/padding for header in
different viewports, it looks great for desktop and ultra wide but too much
spacing for smaller viewports, fixed but reminder if it breaks in the future
problem with huge horizontal gap between project name header and github logo
when header wraps (works for most resolutions, don't have long titles) 0-600:
Mobile 601-900: Tablet 901-1250: Small monitors 1251-2200: Regular Monitors
2201-2800: Wide monitors

Make grid space be for button during mobile Make the navbar appear and overlap
the content using absolute/relative positioning make contact page prettier
(maybe add content for below form and info for > 1250px) Keep text content
concise list logos at bottom of my contact information card? (maybe not since I
only have linkedin, maybe twitter/instagram in the future?)
